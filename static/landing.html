    <p>Hi and welcome to Pupil Tracker. This proof of concept is designed to gather information on how people absorb information from atmospheric science visualisations. This page will give you some instructions. When you're ready, just click the "get started" button below. It'll open in a new tab so you can refer back to these instructions if you want to.</p>

    <a target="_blank" href="pupiltracker.html" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg btn-block">Get started!</a>

    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Click "get started"</li>
      <li>You may need to allow the web page to use your webcam</li>
      <li>You should see your face in the upper left corner. Wait until your face has been recognised - you should see a green mesh appear.</li>
      <li>You should now see a red dot tracking round the screen (if not, try clicking somewhere)</li>
      <li>You can help calibrate the tracker by moving your mouse cursor to a location, staring at the cursor and clicking. Do this until you feel the dot is tracking properly. We'd strongly recommend clicking the "hide/display tracking" button for the calibration so you are not distracted by the dot.</li>
      <li>Once you're happy with the calibration, click "measure accuracy". This will ask you to stare at a dot in the centre of the screen for five seconds (it's harder than it sounds!). If you think you got distracted, you can do this more than once. Again, we'd recommend hiding the tracking to avoid distraction.</li>
      <li>Finally, you can press Start recording which will display an image for you to inspect</li>
      <li>When you're done, just click Stop Recording</li>
      <li>If you press Start again, you should get a different image to assess</li>
      <li>Just quit whenever you've had enough</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>How to help us get accurate data</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Make sure your face is well illuminated</li>
      <li>Keep you head in the box</li>
      <li>Try and keep your head as still as possible</li>
      <li>Use a display that is a big as possible. Note that as long as you do a calibration, you can use the webcam on your laptop, but display the webpage on a (large) external monitor.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>What are you doing with my data?</h1>
    <p>The x,y coordindates of where you look are stored for analysis. There is no video captured. We assign each user a unique ID (by storing a cookie in your browser) so we can tell if one person logs multiple sessions. However, we have no way of linking this ID back to you.</p>
